- "...but neuroscience says otherwise"

#### 4. **Interactive Moments**
- Pause and ask viewer questions
- "Think about when you last procrastinated..."
- Create reflection moments

#### 5. **Expert Authority**
- Reference studies with visuals
- Show paper titles, researcher names
- Build credibility through citations

#### 6. **Longer Scenes**
- Each scene should be 2-4 minutes minimum
- Don't rush - let concepts breathe
- Add more animation and detail

## Our Competitive Advantage

### What We Can Do Better Than Veritasium
1. **Accessibility**: Using Manim means no camera/in-person shooting needed
2. **Consistency**: Repeatable animations across videos
3. **Visual Metaphors**: Abstract concepts made concrete with animation
4. **Cost**: One-person production team feasible
5. **Scalability**: Code-based animations allow rapid iteration

### What We Must Match
1. **Research Quality**: Already strong (RESEARCH_PAPERS.md)
2. **Visual Polish**: Improve transitions and pacing
3. **Storytelling Arc**: Strengthen narrative structure
4. **Emotional Resonance**: Connect more deeply with viewer
5. **Practical Value**: Ensure every tip is actionable

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create research foundation (DONE - RESEARCH_PAPERS.md)
2. ✅ Establish core modules (DONE - core/narration.py, logo.py)
3. 🔄 Enhance visual animations (IN PROGRESS)
4. ⏳ Add myth-busting segments
5. ⏳ Expand scene duration with more detail
6. ⏳ Add statistical visualizations
7. ⏳ Create "experiment" demonstrations

## Quality Level Goal

**Target**: Match or exceed Veritasium's production value while maintaining our unique Manim-animated style.

**Key Differentiator**: Our animations can visualize abstract concepts (like brain processes) in ways that live-action cannot.
