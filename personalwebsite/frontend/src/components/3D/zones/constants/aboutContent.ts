  content: `Hi! I'm Jae Kim, an AI Engineer focused on healthcare ML. I've deployed AI solutions that improve patient outcomes by 25%+ and reduce healthcare costs.

As a Cornell BA/MS '25 student with 2 peer-reviewed publications, I specialize in clinical machine learning, natural language processing, and real-time biosensor systems. I build ML systems that healthcare providers actually use.

Before this I was...
🍎 building an agentic Siri planner powered by Apple Intelligence
🎓 finishing my BS/MS at Penn
🐣 being a kid and having fun (I still try to do this)`,
